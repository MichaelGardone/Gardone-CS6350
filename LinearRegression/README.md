# Homework 2 - Linear Regression

[Link Directly to Results in a Nice Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tn2OAs4lzkiOQVqYruq6UerDEG47V1w36GB4kNc5kbc/edit?usp=sharing)

## Required Libraries

- Pandas
- Numpy

## How to Run

To run Batch GD:

```
python3 batch.py
```

To run Stochastic GD:

```
python3 stochastic.py
```

To run the analytical equation:

```
python3 analytical.py
```

Console flooding doesn't happen with the linear regression output, so no piping is needed.

To run all without running each command individually, enter:

```
./run.sh
```
