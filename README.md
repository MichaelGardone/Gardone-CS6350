# Gardone-CS6350
Repository for CS 6350 @ the University of Utah for Fall 2022. The code presented here was written by Michael Gardone (u1000771) in the graduate section of the Machine Learning course. All READMEs are compiled into this master one, but for more specific/less cluttered please visit each folder.

## DecisionTrees - Homework 1

[Subfolder](https://github.com/MichaelGardone/Gardone-CS6350/tree/main/DecisionTrees)

Be sure to cd into `DecisionTrees` before running the following commands, either in this README or the DecisionTree README.

To run part 1 of the second part of the homework (car dataset), cd to this directory and type:

```
python src/car.py
```

To run part 2 of the second part of the homework (bank dataset), cd to this directory and type:

```
python src/bank.py
```

If you'd like to not flood your console with messages, also add the '> output.txt' piping. You can also run the test dataset (play, from the class slides) to see what is produced to verify the tree being made is correct in all three heuristics. A Python rounding error occurs in Majority Error that causes Humidity to be selected over Outlook (0.xyzw5 vs 0.xyzw4, respectively).

To run both at once, please follow:

```
cd DecisionTrees/src
./run.sh
```
