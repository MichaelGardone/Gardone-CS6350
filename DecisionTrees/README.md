# DecisionTrees -- Homework 1

[Link Directly to Results in a Nice Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gvCrutgdMc4POd3L1EDqRdMT6SLTinyqcwdAGb5YDBw/edit?usp=sharing)

## How to Run

To run part 1 of the second part of the homework (car dataset), cd to into src and type:

```
python3 car.py
```

To run part 2 of the second part of the homework (bank dataset), cd to into src and type:

```
python3 bank.py
```

If you'd like to not flood your console with messages, also add the '> output.txt' piping. You can also run the test dataset (play, from the class slides) to see what is produced to verify the tree being made is correct in all three heuristics.

To run both at once, please follow:

```
cd src
./run.sh
```
