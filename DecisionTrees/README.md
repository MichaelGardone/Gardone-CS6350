# DecisionTrees -- Homework 1

[Link Directly to Results in a Nice Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gvCrutgdMc4POd3L1EDqRdMT6SLTinyqcwdAGb5YDBw/edit?usp=sharing)

## How to Run

To run part 1 of the second part of the homework (car dataset), cd to this directory and type:

```
python src/car.py
```

To run part 2 of the second part of the homework (bank dataset), cd to this directory and type:

```
python src/bank.py
```

If you'd like to not flood your console with messages, also add the '> output.txt' piping. You can also run the test dataset (play, from the class slides) to see what is produced to verify the tree being made is correct in all three heuristics.
